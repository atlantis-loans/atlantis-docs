# Staking

**Atlantis proof-of-stake (PoS)**

Staking ATL is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a PoS based blockchain system.

### ATL-BUSD LP Pool

Staking using the Liquidity Pool requires the user who wants to participate the token $ATL and $BUSD. These will be converted in LP-tokens which you can stake to receive 0.34% daily rewards in $ATL and 0.17% divided by total LP staked on all trades.

> Staking using the Liquidity Pool will reward you with ATL and BUSD.

**How-to**

Visit [Add Liquidity](https://app.1inch.io/#/56/swap/BUSD/0x1fd991fb6c3102873ba68a4e6e6a87b3a5c10271/import-token) or use the link from the Atlantis LP-Pool table. Or import via address: [ATL (BSC)](https://bscscan.com/token/0x1fd991fb6c3102873ba68a4e6e6a87b3a5c10271)

You will be redirected to the DEX. Permission is required by DEX to access your funds, this only required once and will cost you a transaction fee.

**Adding Liquidity**

By typing in the amount of $ATL the $BUSD amount will automatically synchronize the amount is required to stake $BUSD. Share of Pool will give you a estimate percentage of how much you will share the 0.17% of all trades.

**Confirm Supply**

You will receive detailed information about the rates and share of pool.

> When you've confirmed the supply you will receive a option to add LP-token to MetaMask.

**Staking LP-tokens on Atlantis**

The final step is using the Atlantis App to stake the acquired LP-tokens to receive the 0.34% ATL rewards.

> If the price of ATL goes from 10$ to 20$ and you unstake. You will receive 0.5 ATL and 20 BUSD.

### ATL Pool

Staking $ATL will require only to have $ATL in your wallet. Approval like all others you've seen is required as well and only once. On the image below you see Daily Atlantis Rewards. These rewards are in $ATL tokens and shown in USD.

**Staking APR (annual percentage rate)**

APR is normally depicted as a percentage that showcases the real yearly cost, or earnings, of assets over the term of a loan or investment period.

### Unstaking / Unstake tokens

Unstaking can be done on the same page as staking. Click on the button Withdraw and choice the amount you want to unstake.

**Pending Withdrawal List**

After you have approved the transaction you will have to wait 5 min to claim the withdraw. After 5 min you will see the function claim to receive the amount you want to withdrawal.

### Community Pools

On Atlantis we have limited-time pools for the community. For example the last Community Pool was a BUSD Pool where people could stake ATL to receive BUSD for 10 days.
