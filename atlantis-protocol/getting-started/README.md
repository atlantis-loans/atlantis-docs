# Getting Started

These docs are a comprehensive guide to the Atlantis protocol, based on the Atlantis Whitepaper [\(Dec 2021\)](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EC8_o7Egtj65lWh5pXStG0iwhyo29spQ). The protocol is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/atlantis-loans/atlantis-protocol-bsc) and maintained by the community.

Please join the \#development room in the Atlantis community [Discord](https://discord.gg/yF2jFGW3aM) server; our team, and members of the community, look forward to helping you build an application on top of Atlantis protocol. Your questions help us improve, so please don't hesitate to ask if you can't find what you are looking for here.
