# Borrow

The borrow function transfers an asset from the protocol to the user, and creates a borrow balance which begins accumulating interest based on the [Borrow Rate](borrow-rate.md) for the asset. The amount borrowed must be less than the user's [Account Liquidity](../comptroller/get-account-liquidity.md) and the market's available liquidity.

To borrow Ether, the borrower must be 'payable' \(solidity\).
