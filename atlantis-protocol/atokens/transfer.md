# Transfer

Transfer is an ERC-20 method that allows accounts to send tokens to other Ethereum addresses. A aToken transfer will fail if the account has [entered](../comptroller/enter-markets.md) that aToken market and the transfer would have put the account into a state of negative [liquidity](../comptroller/get-account-liquidity.md).

**ABep20 / ABNB**

function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) returns (bool)
```

* `recipient`: The transfer recipient address.
* `amount`: The amount of aTokens to transfer.
* `RETURN`: Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the operation succeeded.
