# ATL/ATLX Token Utility

The Atlantis (ATL/ATLX) token is a utility token designed to facilitate community governance and incentivize other use cases within the Atlantis Ecosystem. 

### Governance
The Atlantis token allows the community to decide the future of the Protocol. Atlantis token holders may stake their Atlantis to vote on or propose new ideas to improve the Atlantisantis Protocol. Some of the decisions could be:
* Adding new cryptocurrencies or stablecoins to the protocol
* Adjusting variable interest rates for all markets
* Voting on protocol improvements/proposals
* Voting for buyback and other activities from the protocol reserves


### Staking
* Atlantis Token is accepted as a staking asset of the liquidity pool ATL-BUSD, ATLX-USDC & ATL-AVAX
* Atlantis Token can also be staked in the ATL/ATLX vault to accumulate more voting power.
* Atlantis Token can be staked in a Community Vault where periodically users will be able to receive other tokens stored in Atlantis reserves. 
* ATL can be staked on Polygon to mine ATLX, the governance token on Polygon.


### Atlantis Premium Services
Atlantis Token can also be used to get access to our premium services. One of the first services we have created is the Telegram Notification service. With this service Atlantis users, and soon users of other lending platforms, are able to get real time notifications about their used loan percentage and other handy statistics.
