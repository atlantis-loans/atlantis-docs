# ATL/ATLX Token Utility

The ATL token is a utility token designed to facilitate community governance and incentivize other use cases within the Atlantis Ecosystem. 

### Governance
The ATL token allows the community to decide the future of the Protocol. ATL token holders may stake their ATL to vote on or propose new ideas to improve the Atlantis Protocol. Some of the decisions could be:
* Adding new cryptocurrencies or stablecoins to the protocol
* Adjusting variable interest rates for all markets
* Voting on protocol improvements/proposals
* Voting for buyback and other activities from the protocol reserves


### Staking
* ATL is accepted as a staking asset of the liquidity pool ATL-BUSD, ATLX-USDC & ATL-AVAX
* ATL can also be staked in the ATL vault to accumulate more voting power.
* ATL can be staked in a Community Vault where periodically users will be able to receive other tokens stored in Atlantis reserves. 
* ATL can be staked on Polygon to mine ATLX, the governance token on Polygon.


### Atlantis Premium Services
ATL can also be used to get access to our premium services. One of the first services we have created is the Telegram Notification service. With this service Atlantis users, and soon users of other lending platforms, are able to get real time notifications about their used loan percentage and other handy statistics.
