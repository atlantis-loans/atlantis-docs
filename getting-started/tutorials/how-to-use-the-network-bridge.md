# How to use the Network Bridge

A cross-chain bridge or a blockchain bridge enables the transfer of tokens, assets, smart contract instructions, or data between blockchains. Two chains may have different protocols, rules, and governance models, but a cross-chain bridge connects these disparate blockchains together by interoperating securely.

There are limited different assets to transfer from network to network, this differs from which network make sure you check if the asset you want to transfer is supported. You can swap token A(Network A) for token B(Network B) and it's not required to be Token A(Network A) to Token A(Network B)
