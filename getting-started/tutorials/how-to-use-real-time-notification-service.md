# How to use real-time notification service

The Atlantis Team has created a bot for its users that brings real-time notifications directly to you through telegram.

### Requirements

* Telegram Messenger
* 500 ATL in the [ATL Vault](https://atlantis.loans/lending)

### Features

* Atlantis Protocol & Venus Protocol&#x20;
* Notifies users when the borrow limit exceeds a limit set by the user. Example: If a user sets their borrow limit to 80%, the telegram bot will send them a notification when that limit is greater than 80%
* Notifies users of their borrow limit at any percentage.
* Notifies users about current oracle prices for all of a user’s supplied and borrowed assets.
* Notifies users about their Atlantis rewards.
* Notifies users every 1 min, 30 min or 4 hours.



### Setup Bot

To set up the Atlantis Bot, users must go to [Atlantis](https://atlantis.loans/dashboard) Application and look for the bell icon on the Application dashboard. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/bell\_icon.png)

![After you click the bell icon, you will be presented with a tab to edit the features of your Atlantis Bot. You can set the borrow limit you want to be notified at and enable/disable features you want.](../../.gitbook/assets/bot\_setup.png)

After confirming your settings, hit save, then **create** a 4-digit pin code. The bot uses the code to link to your DeFi profile. The Bot doesn’t work for multiple wallets so users will have to create a new bot for each unique wallet they connect to Atlantis Protocol.
